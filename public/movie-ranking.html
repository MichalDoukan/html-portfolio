<h1>The best movies according to Michal</h1>
<h2>Here are my top 3 favourite movies:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>I like this movie for the way it reresents how emotions communicate with each other inside of a child's brain.</p>
<h3>Dr. Strange</h3>
<p>I like this movie for the special effects showed in it.<br />
also, I am fascinated by time loops and the multi-verse.</p>
<h3>The king's Speech</h3>
<p>This movie shows how a patient reaches mile stones, one by one, during therapy.<br />
Moreover, It shows that anyone, even a king, might suffer from communication disorders, and that they are treatable.</p>
